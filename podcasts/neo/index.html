People in many parts of the world – including the US and the UK -  now live in societies shaped by an ideology - sometimes called neo-liberalism.  It’s associated with economic liberalization and the promotion of the free market.  And it’s seen as building on old liberal ideas.  Except, says the distinguished political philosopher Elizabeth Anderson, neoliberalism distorts what liberalism once stood for.
