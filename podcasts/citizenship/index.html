<p>Before Thom Brooks could become a British citizen, he had to pass a test.  Some of the questions were so obscure that few British born people could answer them - such as 'which was the first Indian restaurant to open in the UK?' Thom Brooks is not against citizen tests in principle,  but he does think that they are often absurd, and that society could do more to help new citizens to integrate. </p>
