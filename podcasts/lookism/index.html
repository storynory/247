<p>
Some people experience racism, others sexism.But what about victims of lookism?  Well, how good-looking people are affects how theyâ€™re treated in life, and will impact all sorts of things, such as how much they earn.  Francesca Minerva argues that discrimination against the ugly or disfigured needs to be taken more seriously.
