<p>When airport security choose to stop young males of Middle East appearance rather than old white women travelling with their grandkids, that seems both rational and at the same time offensive.  Profiling, particularly racial profiling, is hugely contentious.  But Kasper Lippert-Rasmussen says it is both necessary and pervasive.  And only some kinds of profiling are objectionable. </p>
