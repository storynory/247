<p>Suppose a religious community regards a site – with, say, a stone circle – as sacred.  It has for centuries been used as a place of prayer and contemplation. The land is owned by the state and they want to sell it off to build apartment blocks.  You might think that the deep attachment the religious community has to this place of worship is what gives it some right to protect the site.  But Lea Ypi of the London School of Economics, is not so sure.</p>
