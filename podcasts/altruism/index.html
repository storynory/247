<p>Itâ€™s something of a puzzle that animals are not entirely selfish.  In some cases they even sacrifice their lives for others.  Jonathan Birch at the LSE, says that a proper understanding of evolution can explain that.  It can also explain why humans cooperate with others they consider to be members of their group.  More fundamentally still, it helps us to understand why human beings exist at all. His book, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philosophy-Social-Evolution-Jonathan-Birch/dp/0198733054">is available on Amazon</a>
