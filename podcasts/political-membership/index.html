 <p>People who live in democratic countries won’t all have the same rights.  Children can’t vote, for example.  Some long-term residents, who aren’t citizens, might be able to vote in local but not national elections.  Illegal immigrants can’t vote at all.  Then there are full citizens who live abroad - they might have some, but not necessarily the full set of political rights.  David Edmonds speaks to Seyla Benhabib of Yale University about the nature of political membership.</p>
