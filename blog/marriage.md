<p>David Edmonds talks to Dr Clare Chambers of the University of Cambridge.  Should the state give recognition to marriage? Is it a sexist instituion?  And even if we do not take some of the outdated parts of the ceremony at face value, should the state take any view on how people ought to live their lives? And how have civil partnerships and "gay marriages" changed our ideas of marriage?  </p>
