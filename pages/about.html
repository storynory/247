<p>David has written several acclaimed books on two of his passions, philosophy and chess. His first book was <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wittgensteins-Poker-Argument-Between-Philosophers-ebook/dp/B00PISEAPK/ref=sr_1_8?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1474783235&sr=1-8">Wittgenstein’s Poker</a>, which was an international best-seller.  His most recent published works are <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philosophers-Take-World-David-Edmonds/dp/0198753721">Philosophers Take On The World</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Would-You-Kill-Fat-Man/dp/B00F8MIJ0I/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1474783235&sr=1-2">Would You Kill the Fat Man?</a> which the Wall Street Journal called "A marvel of economy and learning worn lightly."</p>
